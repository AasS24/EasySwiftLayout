I am glad to share with you a lightweight Swift framework for Apple's Auto-Layout. It helps you write readable and compact UI code using simple API. 

At first, it was only a few extenstions of `UIView` desiged for some of my commercial projects, but eventually code continued to grow, so I decided to move it to a seperate framework. I hope some of you find it helpful, so feel free to share your feedback and give some stars to EasySwiftLayout!

If you want to report bug or request new feature - open a ticket. I will try my best to cover them as soon as posible.

- Swift 4+

## Quick Overview

<details>
<summary>pin(topTo:leftTo:bottomTo:rightTo:withInsets:)</summary>
  
##### Summary
Pins edges to the given `NSLayoutAxisAnchor`s.
##### Declaration
```swift
func  pin(topTo  top: NSLayoutYAxisAnchor? = nil, leftTo  left: NSLayoutXAxisAnchor? = nil, bottomTo  bottom: NSLayoutYAxisAnchor? = nil, rightTo  right: NSLayoutXAxisAnchor? = nil, withInsets  insets: UIEdgeInsets = .zero) -> Self
```
##### Discussion

- Compact version of default Swift layout. Allows you to edges to specific  `NSLayoutAxisAnchor`.

- To make Auto-Layout works properly, it automatically sets viewâ€™s property  `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`  to  `false`

##### Precondition

You should pass at least one anchor, otherwise this method will have no effect.

##### Parameters

Parameter  | Type | Description
---------- | ---- |------------
top  | `NSLayoutYAxisAnchor` | Anchor to pin top to.
left  | `NSLayoutXAxisAnchor` | Anchor to pin left to.
bottom | `NSLayoutYAxisAnchor` | Anchor to pin bottom to.
right | `NSLayoutXAxisAnchor` | Anchor to pin right to.
insets | `UIEdgeInsets` | Insets between edges.

##### Returns
`self`  with attribute  `@discardableResult`.

##### Declared In

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate EasySwiftLayout into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'EasySwiftLayout'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate EasySwiftLayout into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "denandreychuk/EasySwiftLayout"
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate EasySwiftLayout into your project manually.

#### Embedded Framework

- Clone this repo by running:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/denandreychuk/EasySwiftLayout.git
  ```
- Navigate to the project folder and open `EasySwiftLayout.xcodeproj`.
- Select scheme `Build Framework` by pressing `^ + 0` and run it on any device. It will automatically generate `EasySwiftLayout.framework` and open it in Finder.
- Move `EasySwiftLayout.framework` file to your project folder.
- Select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the "Targets" heading in the sidebar.
- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the "General" panel.
- Click on the `+` button under the "Embedded Binaries" section.
- Select `EasySwiftLayout.framework` in your project folder.
- And that's it!

  > The `EasySwiftLayout.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.
