I am glad to share with you a lightweight Swift framework for Apple's Auto-Layout. It helps you write readable and compact UI code using simple API. 

At first, it was only a few extenstions of `UIView` desiged for some of my commercial projects, but eventually code continued to grow, so I decided to move it to a seperate framework. I hope some of you find it helpful, so feel free to share your feedback and give some stars to EasySwiftLayout!

If you want to report bug or request new feature - open a ticket. I will try my best to cover them as soon as posible.
